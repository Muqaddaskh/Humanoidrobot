# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Robotics

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics that form the basis for understanding more complex humanoid robot systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand basic robotics terminology and classifications
- Learn about robot components and their functions
- Explore different types of robotic systems
- Grasp the mathematical foundations of robotics

## Introduction

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that underpin all robotic systems.

## 1.1 What is a Robot?

A robot is a programmable machine that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Key characteristics include:

- Programmability
- Sensing capabilities
- Decision-making abilities
- Actuation mechanisms

## 1.2 Types of Robots

Robots can be classified in various ways, including by application, mobility, or control method.

## Summary

This chapter provided an overview of fundamental robotics concepts that will be built upon in subsequent chapters. Understanding these basics is crucial for grasping more advanced humanoid robot concepts.

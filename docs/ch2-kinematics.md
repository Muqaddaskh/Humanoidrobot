# Chapter 2: Kinematics and Dynamics

This chapter covers the mathematical foundations for describing robot motion and understanding the forces involved in robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Master forward and inverse kinematics concepts
- Understand robot dynamics and force analysis
- Learn about Jacobians and their applications
- Apply these concepts to humanoid robot motion

## Introduction

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it, while dynamics deals with the relationship between forces and motion. These concepts are fundamental to controlling robotic systems.

## 2.1 Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics involves calculating the position and orientation of the end-effector based on the joint angles.

## 2.2 Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics determines the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

## Summary

Understanding kinematics and dynamics is essential for controlling robot motion effectively. These principles form the foundation for sophisticated robotic control systems.

# Chapter 7: Motion Planning and Locomotion

This chapter covers the algorithms and techniques used for planning robot motion, with special focus on locomotion for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand motion planning algorithms
- Learn about path planning and trajectory generation
- Explore locomotion strategies for humanoid robots
- Study gait generation and balance control

## Introduction

Motion planning is the process of determining a sequence of movements that achieves a desired goal while avoiding obstacles and respecting robot constraints. For humanoid robots, this includes the complex challenge of bipedal locomotion.

## 7.1 Path Planning Algorithms

Various algorithms exist for planning paths in complex environments while avoiding obstacles.

## 7.2 Gait Generation

Generating stable and efficient walking patterns is a key challenge for humanoid robots.

## Summary

Motion planning and locomotion are critical capabilities for mobile robots, especially for humanoid robots that must navigate in human environments.

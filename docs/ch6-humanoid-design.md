# Chapter 6: Humanoid Robot Design

This chapter focuses specifically on the design principles and challenges unique to humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand the challenges of humanoid robot design
- Learn about bipedal locomotion principles
- Explore anthropomorphic design considerations
- Study balance and stability mechanisms

## Introduction

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and mimic human form and behavior. This design approach presents unique challenges and opportunities compared to other robotic configurations.

## 6.1 Anthropomorphic Design

Designing robots with human-like characteristics requires careful consideration of proportions, degrees of freedom, and appearance.

## 6.2 Bipedal Locomotion

Walking on two legs is one of the most complex challenges in humanoid robotics, requiring sophisticated control algorithms.

## Summary

Humanoid robot design requires balancing anthropomorphic goals with practical engineering constraints to create effective and stable robotic systems.

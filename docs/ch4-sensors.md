# Chapter 4: Sensors and Perception

This chapter covers the various sensors used in robotics and how robots perceive and interpret their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand different types of robotic sensors
- Learn about sensor fusion techniques
- Explore computer vision applications in robotics
- Study perception algorithms for humanoid robots

## Introduction

Sensors are the eyes and ears of robotic systems, providing crucial information about the environment and the robot's own state. Effective perception is essential for autonomous robot operation.

## 4.1 Types of Sensors

Robotic sensors can be classified as internal (proprioceptive) or external (exteroceptive) sensors.

## 4.2 Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to improve perception accuracy and reliability.

## Summary

Sensors and perception systems enable robots to interact intelligently with their environment, forming a crucial component of autonomous robotic systems.

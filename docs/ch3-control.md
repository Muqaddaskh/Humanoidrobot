# Chapter 3: Control Systems

This chapter explores the principles and techniques used to control robotic systems, with emphasis on applications relevant to humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand different types of control systems
- Learn about feedback and feedforward control
- Explore PID controllers and their applications
- Study advanced control strategies for robotics

## Introduction

Control systems are essential for achieving desired robot behavior. They process sensor information and generate appropriate actuator commands to accomplish specific tasks.

## 3.1 Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop Control

Open-loop control operates without feedback, while closed-loop control uses sensor feedback to adjust system behavior.

## 3.2 PID Controllers

Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers are widely used in robotics for their effectiveness and simplicity.

## Summary

Control systems form the brain of robotic systems, determining how robots respond to their environment and achieve their objectives.
